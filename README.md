# Disease_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

Project Description:
Major Libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, Tkinter, os etc.
Designed and implemented a machine learning solution for disease prediction on the basis of the patient Symptoms.
This project trains different machine learning models on the basis of the prepared dataset, and allows prediction from those models on the unseen or testing data.
Project comprises of GUI (Graphical User Interface) designed using python library Tkinter, which creates an ease for the user to input relevant patient data and receive prediction on disease outcomes in the real-time.
